## About The Project
The main challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible with some animation and hover effect.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover & animation states for all interactive elements on the page.
3. . I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with
 * HTML markup
 * CSS custom properties
  * Flex Box
  * Desktop-first workflow
 
## What I learned
A great project to practice some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
